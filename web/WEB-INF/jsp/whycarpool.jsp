    <h1>Benefits of Carpooling</h1>

    <div class="textcontent">
        <p>If you are going nuts navigating the city traffic, here's a solution you might like to try. Car pooling or
            ride
            sharing. It reduces your stress of driving as also has other benefits for you and your society at large. Car
            pooling benefits its members in many ways including saving money, saving fuel, reducing global warming and
            easing traffic.</p>

        <p>The Indian Carpool Survey conducted by Indimoto gives interesting details about the demographic, social and
            economic profile of commuters who have adopted carpooling as a mode of commuting. Over 500 commuters who
            have
            used the internet (carpool listing/classified sites including Indimoto.com) to enter into carpool/rideshare
            arrangements across India since 2006 were surveyed.</p>

        <p>The findings indicate that carpool as a concept has been embraced primarily by educated commuters from major
            metros with well paying jobs. This trend can be attributed to high internet penetration in the metros and
            greater awareness of carpools and its benefits amongst such individuals. Not surprisingly, it is more
            popular in
            cities where the traffic situation is the worst like Delhi, Mumbai and Bangalore.</p>

        <p>The maximum car-poolers belong to New Delhi (57 %) followed by Mumbai (23 %) and Bangalore (8 %). Only 16 per
            cent
            of the car-poolers are female who however believe the concept to be relatively safe. 70 % of car-poolers are
            in the
            age group of 25-40 years (70 per cent). They form the most active working population and commute to work
            daily.</p>

        <p>57 % of car-poolers are highly educated with most holding a post graduate qualification. 99 % of respondents
            carpool
            for an income generating activity and majority (84 per cent) are salaried employees.</p>

        <p>It's not that the car poolers surveyed were short of funds. 57 % earned over Rs. 50,000 per month and 10 %
            upwards
            of Rs.100,000 per month. These are well paid private sector employees, car-pooling to their offices in
            various
            metros. Only 6 % of the car-poolers do not posses a private vehicle while 86 per cent own one or more cars
            and share
            driving responsibilities with fellow car-poolers.</p>

        <p>As expected, majority of car-poolers commute over long distances each day, 84 % commute over 26 kilometres
            everyday
            with 17 % travelling over 76 kilometres on a daily commute. Despite this, 38 % car-poolers are able to keep
            their
            commuting costs below Rs. 3000 per month by carpooling.</p>

        <p>Car-poolers say the primary accrued benefit is the reduction in CO2 emissions which helps them reduce their
            carbon
            footprint in the race to save the planet from global warming. 67 % cited this as the main benefit of
            carpools.
            Indeed highly environmentally conscious.</p>

        <p>62 % appreciated the money saving opportunity through carpooling while 53 % were glad that they were reducing
            traffic on choked city streets. Saving of precious fuel was cited as another benefit by 41% of the
            car-poolers.</p>

        <p>Contrary to popular belief that carpools are a social challenge, 38 % opted for it to increase social
            interaction
            with like minded commuters working or living in their vicinity. Reduction of stress due to driving/commuting
            alone
            encouraged 31 % cent of the respondents to carpool.</p>

        <p>The benefits of car pooling are many. As far as I can see the biggest drawback is it cuts flexibility. You
            are on
            your own if you miss the bus...er, in this case the car!</p>
