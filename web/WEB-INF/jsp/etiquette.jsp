    <h1>Etiquette</h1>


    <div class="textcontent">

        DO:
        <ul>
            <li>Communicate with your fellow carpoolers. If you're running a few minutes late, call them and let them
                know. If you can't carpool on a particular day due to a schedule conflict, give your carpool partners
                ample notice so
                they can make other arrangements.
            </li>
            <li>Drive safely at all times.</li>
            <li>Keep your vehicle clean and in good condition.</li>
            <li>Respect any other restrictions the carpool has agreed on, such as smoking, eating or drinking.</li>
        </ul>

        DON'T:
        <ul>
            <li>Make a habit of being late.</li>
            <li>Ask your carpoolers to make extra stops along the way so you can take care of personal errands. The
                carpool is meant to help everyone with their commutes, period.
            </li>
            <li>Bring up controversial topics like religion or politics unless you know your fellow carpoolers well.
                While some people enjoy debating the issues, others may prefer a quieter commute.
            </li>
            <li>Have lengthy cell phone conversations while you're in the carpool.</li>
        </ul>
